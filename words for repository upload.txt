
File.ReadAllLines(â€¦) method opens a text file,
reads all lines of the file, and then closes the file.
This method attempts to automatically detect the encoding
of a file based on the presence of byte order marks.
Encoding formats UTF-8 and UTF-32 (both big-endian and
little-endian) can be detected.
